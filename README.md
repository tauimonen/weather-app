A simple responsive website for a weather reporting company made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. By searching for a location, 
the site shows the current weather in the destination. The backend of the page uses 
OpenWeatherMap's API. In the future, it will be possible to add links 
to the company's social media and directories to the page. Also the site's language change 
functionality is possible to implement. The icons and directories are ready on the page.
The gallery is intended for weather-related images uploaded by customers, and the images 
are to be retrieved from a database to which the approved images are added. One could add 
a photo of the week separately to the page.
